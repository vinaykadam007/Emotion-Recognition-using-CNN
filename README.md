# Emotion Recognition using CNN

## Description:
Welcome to the Emotion Recognition System using CNN project! This repository showcases an exciting application of deep learning and computer vision. The primary aim of this project is to build an emotion recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system can accurately detect two emotions: happiness and sadness. By analyzing facial expressions, it provides insights into the emotional state of individuals in images.

## Features:
- Emotion recognition using CNN architecture
- Training on labeled happy and sad emotion datasets
- Real-time emotion prediction on images
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Scalable for potential inclusion of additional emotions

Clone this repository to your local machine using:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-recognition-cnn.git

## Usage:
Once you've cloned the repository and installed the required packages, you can employ the provided Python script to utilize the emotion recognition system. The script utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks to predict emotions based on facial expressions.

## Contributing:
Contributions to enhance and expand the emotion recognition system's capabilities are highly welcome. If you have ideas for improvements, additional emotions, or optimizations, please feel free to open issues and pull requests.

Feel free to adjust this template according to your project's specifics. Enjoy exploring the world of emotion recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks!
